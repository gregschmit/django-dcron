=============
:code:`dcron`
=============

This is a bad software project. I recommend using `django-cron`. I created this project because I wanted to build model-based jobs, however this requires iterating over model instances, which is a silly thing to do, which is apparent as soon as you have a large enough database.

So I am closing this project, because I think humanity would be better off without it.
